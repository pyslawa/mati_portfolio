## Task 1: Software configuration
###  Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the challenge portfolio?
Hello my name is Patrycja. I took part in the project because 
thought it would be another important challenge for me. 
After all, it is not every day that materials for future 
automation super testers are created! ðŸ’ª
<br> 
<br>My main task is to make you interested in the topic and make you feel 
that automation gives you pleasure. I will be the happiest in the world if 
in the future you will share with me whether you managed to get a job as an 
automation tester!

###Good luck!
